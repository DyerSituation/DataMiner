A detailed description explaining: (a) which NYC Open Data data set(s) you used to generate the INTEGRATED-DATASET file; (b) what (high-level) procedure you used to map the original NYC Open Data data set(s) into your INTEGRATED-DATASET file; (c) what makes your choice of INTEGRATED-DATASET file compelling (in other words, justify your choice of NYC Open Data data set(s)). The explanation should be detailed enough to allow us to recreate your INTEGRATED-DATASET file exactly from scratch from the NYC Open Data site.

(a) We used only the New York City Leading Causes of Death Data set
(b) We exported the file to CSV, then removed columns that contained only numerical data (years, death numbers, death rate, adjusted death rate) from the CSV file. 
(c) The health and wellbeing of its citizens should be at the top of any government's priorty list, and one way to monitor this is by analyzing the data on the leading causes of deaths. Analysing this dataset for association rules will show which demographic groups are being affected by which causes of death. Rules where certain causes are disproportionately affecting different groups (of which there are many) should be investigated, as they may be signs of areas where the government could further protect the health of its citizens
